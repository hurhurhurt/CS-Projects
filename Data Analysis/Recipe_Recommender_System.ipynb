    "# Recipe Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I expand on my previous findings in \"Recipe_Analysis.ipynb\" and begin the process of building a recommender system for Asian-inspired recipes from thewoksoflife.com. In this specific notebook, I will continue on basic exploratory data analysis and develop collaborative-filtering based methods to index recipes based on user input. I plan to use this data and build a full-stack web application to deploy on github allowing people to, based on specific parameters like their available time, calorie preferences, and of course choice of protein, receive a list of the top 5 recipes based on their criteria."

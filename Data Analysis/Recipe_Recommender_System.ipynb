    "# Recipe Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I expand on my previous findings in \"Recipe_Analysis.ipynb\" and begin the process of building a recommender system for Asian-inspired recipes from thewoksoflife.com. In this specific notebook, I will continue on basic exploratory data analysis and utilize machine learning & NLP for recipe recommendation.. I plan to use this data and build a full-stack web application to deploy on github allowing people to, based on specific parameters like their available time, calorie preferences, and of course choice of protein, receive a list of the top 5 recipes based on their criteria."

At first, I considered using TF-IDF for this, but since it places weights on each word depending on frequency, it seems antithetical to the task. Instead, I am opting for cosine similiarity.\n",

    "Cosine similarity is a method often used in text analysis and measures the similarity between two vectors in a given space. It functions by determining whether the cosine of two plotted vectors are \"pointing\" in the same direction. These vectors, also known as term-frequency vectors, store the occurrence of each word in a 2D array. For example, given the following two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**I like cats, cats like me.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cats are really fun!**\n",

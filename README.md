This is a program to scrape, format, and analyze recipes from thewoksoflife.com, a reputable Asian cooking website. In the future, I may expand to other recipe websites, but currently functionality is limited to the Woks of Life.

In this program, I first get the urls of each category listed and scrape their names, cooking times, ingredients, calories, review counts, and average ratings.  I then send the data into a CSV file where I clean the data and perform data analysis using matplotlib and the seaborn libraries. My goal is to eventually develop a recommendation engine, where based on a user's input of available ingredients, output a list of potential recipes that they may want to cook.

#Recipe Scraping Project w/ Data Analysis & Recommender System (in progress)

**About:**
This is a project to celebrate the diversity of Asian Food through data visualization of thousands of Asian recipes. The program will also include a recommender system in the future, where based on a user's available ingredients, will suggest a highly rated recipe. All data is scraped from thewoksoflife.com, and I greatly thank them for allowing me the opportunity to conduct this project.

**Installation:**
To scrape recipes, simply installing and running the Recipe_Scraper.py file will generate an uncleaned csv file (the terminal will ask you to name this csv file). If you would prefer to simply see the visualization, all relevant graphs will be available inside the repo; otherwise, you can view them in the .ipynb file.
